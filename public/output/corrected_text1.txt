Hello everyone, this is Amit Kumar Singh, a student in the fifth semester of computer science engineering, and now I am going to tell you a bit about myself. I am a basic developer, and I am interested in Python and JavaScript. I have done a few projects based on Python, JavaScript, and other frameworks. My hobbies include playing chess and badminton.
